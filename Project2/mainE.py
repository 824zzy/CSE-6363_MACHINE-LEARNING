"""Description
Write a computer program to implement SVM method.
(i)preprocessthe data instances:if data instances have categorical features, then call the subroutine convert(X). 
(ii) given the training data instances, your program should be able to compute the w, b, alpha, margin.
(iii) when a new data instance is presented, the program uses pre-trained SVM model to predict the class label for the new data instance.
